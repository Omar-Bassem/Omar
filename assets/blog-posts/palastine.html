                The Israeli war on the Gaza Strip continues for the 172nd day, amid violent bombardment that leaves
                hundreds of deaths and wounded daily, while the occupation expands its war against the health sector and
                hospitals in the Strip.<br>
                <br>
                For their part, the Palestinian resistance factions continue to target the occupation army forces in the
                vicinity of the Shifa Medical Complex, while the occupation is abusing the sick, wounded, and medical
                personnel inside the hospital.<br>
                <br>
                The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Tuesday that the Israeli occupation forces are
                tightening their siege of health personnel, the sick and the wounded in the Shifa Medical Complex,
                noting that they are detaining them inside the human resources development building in the complex that
                is not prepared for health care, and preventing them from leaving it.<br>
                <br>
                It also announced that the Israeli occupation army committed 8 massacres, leaving 81 deaths and 93
                wounded within 24 hours, which raises the toll of the Israeli war on Gaza to 32,414 deaths and 274,787
                injuries since the 7th of last October.<br>
                <br>
                The ministry added in a statement that the medical teams and besieged patients reiterated their appeal
                to all UN institutions and the international community to intervene urgently to save their lives.<br>
                <br>
                Meanwhile, the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees
                (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, said that the Israeli occupation’s decision to prevent the agency’s convoys
                from passing into northern Gaza aims to “prevent people at risk of death” from surviving. He revealed
                that the UN agency has sufficient funds to run its operations until the end of next May.<br>
                <br>
                In the meantime, the Gaza government media office said that 18 Palestinians were killed during the past
                hours due to incorrect landings of aid from planes, including 12 who drowned and 6 due to stampedes,
                holding the US administration and the Israeli occupation responsible for the policy of starvation and
                siege.<br>
                <br>
                It added in a statement that 12 Palestinians died by drowning in the sea off the northern Gaza Strip
                governorate, while they were trying to obtain aid dropped by planes into the sea, which caused them to
                drown.<br>
                <br>
                The office noted that 6 other Palestinians died as a result of the stampede in more than one place as
                they were trying to obtain aid that was dropped by planes incorrectly, also in light of the ongoing
                famine, considering that the operations of landing aid from planes have now constituted a real danger to
                the lives of hungry citizens.<br>
                <br>
                In the same statement, the office called for an end to the operations of delivering aid in this
                offensive, wrong, inappropriate and useless manner, demanding that the land crossings be opened
                immediately and quickly to bring humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people who are suffering from
                hunger and suffering from an acute food shortage for the sixth month in a row.<br>
                <br>
                These developments coincide with the adoption by the UN Security Council of a resolution, the first of
                its kind, demanding an immediate ceasefire during the month of Ramadan. The resolution was welcomed by
                Arab and international audiences but was rejected by Israel.<br>
                <br>
                At the level of negotiations, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) said that it informed the
                mediators that it is adhering to its position and vision that it presented on March 14, stressing that
                its basic demands are “a comprehensive ceasefire, withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and the return of the
                displaced, and a real exchange of prisoners.<br>

                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>“Palestine” was a common name used until 1948 to describe the geographic region between
                        the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. In its history, the Assyrians, Babylonians,
                        Persians,
                        Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians, among others, have controlled Palestine at one time or another.
                        The
                        Ottoman Empire ruled the region from the 1500s through 1917.</p>
