                Ball has not played since Jan. 27 for the Hornets (18-54), whoâ€™ve been eliminated from postseason
                competition. Charlotte has missed the playoffs in eight straight seasons, the longest drought in the
                NBA.
                <br><br>
                The 22-year-old Ball, who signed a five-year max contract extension in July, has had repeated problems
                with ankle injuries since coming into the league and has played in just 58 games over the last two
                seasons.
                <br><br>
                Ball had been playing well before going out, averaging a career-high 23.9 points per game this season.
                Ball was the NBA Rookie of the Year in 2021 and an All-Star the following season.
